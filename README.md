## Instances
New instances will be added at the bottom of the page. **Improperly configured instances may be removed without any warnings.** Instances with a CDN will be prioritized compared to instances without one.

To add a new instance, add a new row in `content/docs/public-instances/index.md` and create a pull request at the ![Documentation repository](https://github.com/TeamPiped/documentation).
